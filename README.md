I am a machine learning researcher and applied mathematician. I am quite interested in Monte Carlo methods, diffusion models, bandit, and reinforcement learning.

#### Research

- **[Contour Sampler](https://github.com/WayneDW/Contour-Stochastic-Gradient-Langevin-Dynamics)** is the first Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves free-mode explorations in MNIST dataset [\[Demo\]](https://github.com/WayneDW/Interacting-Contour-Stochastic-Gradient-Langevin-Dynamics/blob/main/figures/ICSGLD_losses_path.gif); to my best knowledge, no other samplers can achieve this goal in this seemingly-basic task. <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WayneDW/Contour-Stochastic-Gradient-Langevin-Dynamics?style=social">

- **[Non-reversible Parallel Tempering in DNN](https://github.com/WayneDW/Non-reversible-Parallel-Tempering-for-Deep-Posterior-Approximation)** shows that **cyclical (cosine, etc) learning rate** actually is a weak version of non-reversible parallel tempering. <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WayneDW/Non-reversible-Parallel-Tempering-for-Deep-Posterior-Approximation?style=social">

- **[Contour Samplers - Jax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax)** provides a Jax implementaion of Contour samplers (ongoing...)

#### Application

- **[NLP in Finance](https://github.com/WayneDW/Sentiment-Analysis-in-Event-Driven-Stock-Price-Movement-Prediction)** leverage sentiment analysis to predict stock price movement for each News headline <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WayneDW/Sentiment-Analysis-in-Event-Driven-Stock-Price-Movement-Prediction?style=social">

- **[DeepLight](https://github.com/WayneDW/DeepLight_Deep-Lightweight-Feature-Interactions)** wins a SOTA for CTR prediction in Ad Serving [![PWC](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://paperswithcode.com/badge/a-sparse-deep-factorization-machine-for/click-through-rate-prediction-on-criteo)](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/click-through-rate-prediction-on-criteo?p=a-sparse-deep-factorization-machine-for) <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WayneDW/DeepLight_Deep-Lightweight-Feature-Interactions?style=social">
